## Protocol

This device uses the [shared HID protocol](shared-hid-protocol.md) used by other
meters in the FreeStyle family. Most of the text command share the same message
type `0x60`, except where otherwise noted.

## Commands

The Libre supports a distinct set of commands from those described in the shared
protocol. In particular, the following commands are not supported:

  * `$serlnum?` — replaced by `$sn?`.

The following text commands are instead added:

  * `$dbrnum?`
  * `$history?`
  * `$arresult?`
  * `$swreset`
  * `$resetpatient`

## `$dbrnum?`

    dbrnum-response = "DBRECORDS = " 1*DIGIT CRLF

The response includes the number of records in the database (history results.)

## `$history?`

The `$history?` command returns all the automatic measurements taken by the
sensors. It does not include the immediate measurements on user request, nor
strip measurements (blood glucose and β-ketone).

The output follows the *Multiple record command* output format as described in
the shared protocol documentation.

### Record fields

  1. `record-id = 1*5DIGIT`
  2. `unknown = "12"`
  3. `month = 1*2DIGIT`
  4. `day = 1*2DIGIT`
  5. `year = 1*2DIGIT`
  6. `hour = 1*2DIGIT`
  7. `minute = 1*2DIGIT`
  8. `second = 1*2DIGIT`
  9. `unknown = "1"`
  10. `unknown = "0"`
  11. `unknown = "0"`
  12. `unknown = "0"`
  13. `unknown = "0" / "1"`

      This value appears to only be 1 for the first reading of the sensor (with
      sensor runtime reporting 15 minutes).
  14. `value = 1*DIGIT`
  15. `sensor-runtime-minutes = 1*DIGIT`
  16. `error-bitfield = 1*5DIGIT`

      This field needs to be interpreted as a bitfield (in decimal
      representation). Flag 0x8000 indicates an error (invalid reading). If the
      error flag is set, the remaining bits refer to more error details that are
      not clear.

## `$arresult?`

The `$arresult?` returns manual measurements taken by the user, either by
scanning the sensor or using a testing strip (for either blood sugar or β-ketone
measurement)

The output follows the *Multiple record command* output format as described in
the shared protocol documentation.

Multiple record types have been identified; the second value in the record
identifies the type; type 2 is a manual reading, record type 5 identifies a time
change event.

### Reading record fields

  1. `record-id = 1*5DIGIT`
  2. `record-type = "2"`
  3. `month = 1*2DIGIT`
  4. `day = 1*2DIGIT`
  5. `year = 1*2DIGIT`
  6. `hour = 1*2DIGIT`
  7. `minute = 1*2DIGIT`
  8. `second = 1*2DIGIT`
  9. `unknown = "1"`
  10. Identifies the type of reading in the record

      ```
      reading-type = blood-glucose / blood-ketone / sensor-glucose
      blood-glucose = "0"
      blood-ketone = "1"
      sensor-glucose = "2"
      ```
  11. `unknown = "0"`
  12. `unknown = "0" / "1"`

      This appears to be 1 when either an error is present, or when the read
      value is LO.
  13. `value = 1*DIGIT`

      When `reading-type` is either `blood-glucose` or `sensor-glucose`, this
      represent the blood sugar reading in mg/dL.

      When `reading-type` is `blood-ketone`, this represent the β-ketone
      reading in mmol/l after apply `value`/18. It seems that the value is reported 
      in mg/dL and the conversion is using the wrong molar mass system for conversion.
      But based on actual measurements the results are correct this way.
  14. `unknown = "0" / "1"`

      This appears to be 0 for values read from a blood strip, and 1 for values
      read from sensor. Appears redundant with the `reading-type` field.
  15. Corresponds to the arrow indicator in the UI.

      ```
      direction-indicator = none / down-fast / down / steady / up / up-fast
      none = "0"
      down-fast = "1"
      down = "2"
      steady = "3"
      up = "4"
      up-fast = "5"
      ```
  16. `sports-flag = "0" / "1"`
  17. `medication-flag = "0" / "1"`
  18. `rapid-acting-insulin-flag = "0" / "1"`

      See field 44 for value†.
  19. `long-acting-insulin-flag = "0" / "1"`

      See field 24 for value.
  20. `custom-comments-bitfield = 1*DIGIT`

      Custom comments 1-6 flags. To be interpreted as a bitfield, LSB first.
  21. `unknown = "0"`
  22. `unknown = "0"`
  23. `unknown = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5"`
  24. Value of long Acting insulin in 0.5 IE. If you want proper IE, divide by 2
  25. `unknown = "0" / "1"`
  26. `food-flag = "0" / "1"`

      See field 27 for value.
  27. `food-carbs-grams = 1*DIGIT`
  28. `unknown = "0"`
  29. `error-bitfield = 1*5DIGIT`

      This field needs to be interpreted as a bitfield (in decimal
      representation). Flag 0x8000 indicates an error (invalid reading). If the
      error flag is set, the remaining bits refer to more error details that are
      not clear.

      In the Event View on the device, these correspond to Err3 errors.
  30. `custom-comment-1 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  31. `custom-comment-2 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  32. `custom-comment-3 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  33. `custom-comment-4 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  34. `custom-comment-5 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  35. `custom-comment-6 = DQUOTE *VCHAR DQUOTE` ‡
  36. `unknown` †
  37. `unknown` †
  38. `unknown` †
  39. `unknown` †
  40. `unknown` †
  41. `unknown` †
  42. `unknown` †
  43. `unknown` †
  44. Value of rapid acting insulin in 0.5 IE. If you want proper IE, divide by 2.

† The number of columns in a record can be different. If a rapid acting insulin
value has been set, then it is > 44, otherwise the record has only entries up to
comment 6.

‡ Be aware that custom comments are shown in every record. The bitfield in
field 19. shows which comments are actually set.

## `$swreset` and `$resetpatient`

These two commands allow resetting the memory of a FreeStyle Libre
device. Expected response is not documented as they have not been tested on a
device yet.
