# Contributing Reverse Engineered Protocols

Please create a top-level directory for each of the manufacturers, and place the
protocol specifications within those directories. If the same device is marketed
under different brand names, use the manufacturer's name and then list the known
aliases in the document.

Use Markdown format to describe the protocol, and try to use
[ABNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) for the
description of the protocol, particularly for binary-based protocols.
